## Abstract

This project will provide you a step-by-step process in creating your first reproducible project using the following computational tools: bash, markdown, pandoc, git,, github, Make, and Sublime (or any text editor of your choice).## Introduction

The purpose of this project is to get you familiar with using the computational tools learned in class and to create your first reproducible project. I will guide you closely as you create your own github local respository and advise the difficulties I have encountered in my experience with this project. In the next section, I will discuss about all the tools used and its roles in the reproducible workflow. By providing illustrations of the computational tools and the exact code I used to produce this project, you will find it very easy to continue on creating future reproducible projects on your own.## Discussion

Do I make branches for sections and paper?
How should I download the png files or can I just drag them over?
what do I ignore in .gitignore
Do we make the paper.md? Or do we create it first, then edit the md in sublime? Or do we produce paper.md in the Makefile using the logos and sections? If so, do we also clean the paper.md like we did for paper.html?
Do I use file system to use the .png for this .md file?
Do I need to create a branch? What are branches for?
