Do I make branches for sections and paper?
How should I download the png files or can I just drag them over?
what do I ignore in .gitignore
Do we make the paper.md? Or do we create it first, then edit the md in sublime? Or do we produce paper.md in the Makefile using the logos and sections? If so, do we also clean the paper.md like we did for paper.html?
Do I use file system to use the .png for this .md file?
Do I need to create a branch? What are branches for?
