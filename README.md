# Project-title: stat159-fall2016-project1
## Author: Timothy Park

Images: contains png images used to illustrate the contents of the markdown files in the paper/sections folder.

Makefile: a makefile to replicate the project fast and easily. Assuming the present working directory to be in the main folder, simply type `make` into the command line and the html and markdown outputs will be created in the paper directory. Typing in `make clean` would rid of these outputs and prepare the project for various reproducible uses.

Paper: contains the html and markdown outputs for the report and the sections directory, which contains the markdown content files. These four files (Abstract, Introduction, Discussion, Conclusions) is concatenated into one markdown file called paper.md, which is done by the Makefile
